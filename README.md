# YOLOv7 Emotion Detection Project
## Overview
### This project employs YOLOv7 for emotion detection, specifically focusing on accurately identifying six different emotions: anger, happy, disgust, sad, fear, and surprise. The model has been trained on a meticulously curated custom dataset, with annotations generated using Roboflow. The goal is to develop a robust system capable of recognizing nuanced facial expressions, making it applicable in various contexts, such as human-computer interaction and sentiment analysis.
