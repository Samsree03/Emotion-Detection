# YOLOv7 Emotion Detection Project
## Overview
This project employs YOLOv7 for emotion detection, specifically focusing on accurately identifying six different emotions: anger, happy, disgust, sad, fear, and surprise. The model has been trained on a meticulously curated custom dataset, with annotations generated using Roboflow. The goal is to develop a robust system capable of recognizing nuanced facial expressions, making it applicable in various contexts, such as human-computer interaction and sentiment analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of images capturing diverse facial expressions corresponding to six emotions. Each image is meticulously labeled with the appropriate emotionâ€”anger, happy, disgust, sad, fear, or surprise. This dataset, is a crucial foundation for training the YOLOv7 model to accurately identify and classify emotions in real-world scenarios.
## Annotation
The dataset annotation is a critical step in ensuring the YOLOv7 model's efficacy. Roboflow is employed to meticulously annotate each image, providing bounding boxes around facial features associated with the targeted emotions. The annotated data is available here, and it serves as the training ground for the model to learn and generalize patterns associated with different emotional expressions.
## YOLOv7 Model
The YOLOv7 model serves as the backbone of our emotion detection system. This state-of-the-art object detection system is tailored for the nuanced task of identifying emotions in facial expressions. Its architecture is optimized for real-time applications, making it efficient for detecting and classifying emotions in images. The configuration files and model weights are available within this repository, allowing for seamless integration and utilization.
## Methodology
The methodology begins with dataset curation, followed by meticulous annotation using Roboflow. With a well-annotated dataset in hand, the YOLOv7 model is trained to learn and generalize patterns associated with different emotions. Evaluation metrics guide the assessment of model performance, leading to adjustments as needed. The final trained model is deployed for real-time inference, showcasing its ability to accurately identify and classify emotions in new images.
## Results
The trained YOLOv7 model demonstrates good progress in accurately detecting and classifying emotions within facial expressions. Evaluation metrics, as well as visualizations in the results directory, provide insights into the model's performance on both training and validation datasets.
